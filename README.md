# Anna_Sokolovska_teladoc_challenge
This is a BDD Framework that I build with Maven and use of Dependencies, which are stored in pom.xml file. I was using Java as my programming language and was writing my step implementation. I used Selenium for automation, as an open source library. JUnit as test scripting. Selenium WebDriver. Apachi POI dependency for reading data from external sources(CSV and (Excel Sheet). POM and Singleton Driver as a design pattern. I store test data in Configuration Properties and read it by ConfigurationReader. This framework generates Cucumber html report and Json report. I can run it from Feature level in feature folder or from CukesRunner class in runner package.
